Objective

The purpose of this project is to analyse the largest bike sharing program in the United States in the iconic New York City, where the program is widely adopted and used. We’ve analysed the data from 2020 to find trends and phenomena to help the business get a better understanding in the programs. 

Process

We’ve utilized the massive data set provided by New York Citi Bike Program. Which has been collected, collated and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage by months. For our project we’ve analysed data for January to – December 2020.
We have collated the 2020 data and unionised it in Tableau, to analyse it as a single source. From there we’ve made data visualisations to assess and discover phenomena that could be beneficial to Citi Bikes.

Observations

For 2020 these were the phenomena that we’ve discovered based on our observations are:
• Peak usage generally happens around rush hours mornings (around 8 AM) and evenings (around 6PM). Indicating that commuting to and from work could be a factor for bike use.
• Winter has the lowest usage, and although certain weeks in Autumn has the highest usage peaks. Overall Summer has the most trips recorded out of all the seasons. This summer high also expands to distance travelled and duration of used.
• When analysing usage hours and days heat map for low season (winter) and high season (summer). The major difference is around higher usage on Weekends between 9AM – 8PM for the summer season.
• The top starting stations are also the top ending stations. Indicating the areas where CITI Bikes are the most popular. The hotspot are the areas between Jersey City and Manhattan.
• Due to high usage, Citi Bikes do undergo wear and tears.  But what factors would most indicate the need for servicing? Would it be the number of used, time in action or the distance most travelled? We have collated the summary of these info to be sorted for assessment.
• Subscribers accounts for the majority of users. Overall, 69% to 31% who are just general users.
• The majority demographics of users consist of males between the ages of 25 – 45 years of age.
• Female users are the lower user demographics. Future marketing campaigns by Citi Bikes should aim at boosting this number and encourage more female users.
